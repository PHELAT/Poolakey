}
```

### Reactive Extension Support

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation "com.phelat:poolakey-rx:[latest_version]"
}
```
And instead of using Poolakey's callbacks, use the reactive fuctions:
```kotlin
payment.getPurchasedProducts()
    .subscribe({ purchasedProducts ->
        ...
    }, { throwable ->
        ...
    })
```
